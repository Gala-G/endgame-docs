# Overview

## The Endgame Plan

The Endgame Plan is a proposal to overhaul and improve the ecosystem, governance, and tokenomics of the Maker Protocol. Its primary aim is for the protocol to reach a self-sustainable equilibrium called the Endgame State. In this state, the protocol is intrinsically resilient, and the scope and complexity of the core protocol will no longer change.

The Endgame Plan was [introduced](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/decentralized-voter-committee-on-tuesday-5pm-cest-all-mkr-holders-welcome/15166) by Rune Christensen, the founder of Maker. After a series of initial discussions, the [MIP set](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmTmS5Nf) ratifying this plan was accepted by Maker Governance on 24 October 2022. 

The latest version describing the Endgame Plan is available [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/endgame-plan-v3-complete-overview/17427).

## Goals

The Endgame Plan has multiple goals which come together to create the Endgame State. A non-exhaustive list of these goals is presented below.
- Ensure that Maker Core is more resilient to external risks such as regulatory action.
- Ensure that the protocol can scale sustainably.
- Realign incentives for various parties in the Maker ecosystem.
- Reduce governance overhead for MKR holders and Maker delegates.
- Eliminate scope creep in the core protocol.
- Reduce MKR concentration through revised tokenomics and MKR emissions.

## Core Elements

The Endgame Plan consists of the following main components:
- [SubDAOs](link.md)
    - The Endgame Plan is based on reorganizing the existing decentralized workforce ecosystem into new self-sustainable DAOs called SubDAOs. Since each SubDAO is a DAO, it will have its own governance token, governance processes, workforce, interfaces, and users.
    - After their launch, SubDAOs are expected to maintain a synergistic relationship with Maker Core through appropriate alignment of incentive structures.
    - Moving much of the developmental, operational, and governance work to SubDAOs makes Maker Core simpler and more resilient.
- [Scopes and Frameworks](scopes-and-frameworks/scopes-and-frameworks.md)
    - Maker Core will consist of twelve Scopes. A Scope is a broad focus area for any work done to operate or improve the protocol. 
    - The objective of introducing Scopes is to limit scope creep and ensure that any work done is aligned with Maker Core's goals.
    - Frameworks define the rules that SubDAOs must adhere to. Frameworks are expected to be refined over time to maximize profit and minimize risk to Maker Core.
    - Frameworks limit the governance overhead by ensuring that Maker Core only focuses on high-level decisions. They also encourage innovation among SubDAOs without allowing them to take excessive risks that may damage Maker Core. 
- [Decentalized Voter Committees](addlink.com)
    - Decentralized Voter Committees (DVCs) are a group of voters with aligned overall values and views. DVCs directly engage in the important high-level questions of Maker Governance.
    - The objective of DVCs is to ensure that they represent MKR voters that are aligned with the values of that DVC. Members of DVCs will be compensated for their engagement under certain conditions, thereby incentivizing active governance. 
- [Updated Tokenomics](tokenomics/endgame-launch-tokenomics.md)
    - The Endgame Plan has two major tokenomics updates. First, annual MKR minting will be used to incubate SubDAOs, fund DVCs, and incentivize the workforce. These emissions counteract the MKR burn and reduce the likelihood of MKR becoming concentrated in the hands of large holders.
    - The Endgame Plan introduces [Elixir](tokenomics/elixir.md) and [SubElixir](tokenomics/subelixir.md), which are liquidity pool tokens representing liquidity pools holding various combinations of MKR, ETH, DAI and SubDAO governance tokens. The aim of these tokens is twofold. It ensures alignment of interests between Maker Core and SubDAOs and also improves liquidity for all these tokens on the open market. 
- Other Aspects
    - [EtherDAI](tokenomics/etherdai.md): ETH and staked ETH will play a major role in ensuring the financial resilience of Maker Core. EtherDAI is a synthetic Ether token backed by liquid staked Ether tokens and debt issued by Maker.
    - In the final stages of Endgame, DAI is envisioned to turn into an Unbiased World Currency. In particular, it is not expected to remain pegged to the US Dollar and will instead have alternative mechanisms that determine its Target Price. 
    - MKR tokens will no longer function as a backstop in the event that the protocol is insolvent - instead, this will be reflected in the Target Price of DAI. 

## Implementation

### Phases
The Endgame Plan will be implemented in four main phases. These are the Pregame, Early Game, Midgame, and Endgame phases. Due to the changes that are likely to occur to the Endgame Plan, this section only elaborates on details of the Pregame Phase. 

The Pregame Phase will involve the following main changes, not necessarily in this order:
- Publication of the Maker Constitution - a document that contains broad guidelines on the objectives and vision for Maker.
- Launch of the first SubDAOs.
- Updated tokenomics to include MKR emissions, Elixir, and SubElixir.
- Reorganization of the workforce into entities that fit within the Endgame paradigm
- Accumulating staked ETH and building on the staked ETH ecosystem through EtherDAI.

### Stances

The Endgame Plan requires the Maker Protocol to be able to handle the possibility that there will be significant changes in regulatory frameworks and macroeconomic circumstances. The protocol will adopt three possible stances to balance risk and long-term reward as it reacts to these changes. Further details can be found [here](stances.md).
