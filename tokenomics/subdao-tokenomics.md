## SubDAO Token Emissions

The initial supply of each subDAO token is 2.6 billion. 

400 million SubDAO tokens are used as incentives for the SubDAO's workforce.

200 million SubDAO tokens are sold for DAI over a period of 2 years and used to fund the SubDAO treasury.

2 billion of each SubDAO's tokens will be available for yield farming during the first 10 years of the SubDAO's lifespan. 1 billion will be distributed in the first 2 years, half of that in the next 2 years, and so on.

Additionally, each SubDAO emits 3% of their total supply each year.
