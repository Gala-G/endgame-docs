# SubDAO Tokenomics

Each Maker SubDAO has its own SubDAO token. Each SubDAO token is a new token that is minted by Maker Core and distributed widely via token farming initiatives.

## Stated Goals

There are a multiple goals that Maker intends to meet via the SubDAO tokenomics.

1. To distribute the ownership of each SubDAO as widely as possible.
2. To ensure that SubDAO creation drives value to Maker Core in the form of:
    a) Dai demand
    b) Stability Fees
    c) EtherDai adoption
    d) Governance participation
3. To incentivize talented individuals to work to make each SubDAO a success.

## SubDAO Token Emissions

The initial supply of each subDAO token is 2.6 billion. 

400 million SubDAO tokens are used as incentives for the SubDAO's workforce.

200 million SubDAO tokens are sold for DAI over a period of 2 years and used to fund the SubDAO treasury.

2 billion of each SubDAO's tokens will be available for yield farming during the first 10 years of the SubDAO's lifespan. 1 billion will be distributed in the first 2 years, half of that in the next 2 years, and so on.

Additionally, each SubDAO emits 3% of their total supply each year.

## SubDAO Token Farming

20% of the initial SubDAO token distribution is farmable by Dai holders.

40% of the initial SubDAO token distriubtion is farmable by EtherDai vault owners.

40% of the initial SubDAO token distribution is farmable by MKR holders that are active in Maker Core governance.
